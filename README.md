# Hellooo

This is a 'frontend' for my `pl-chess` command line tool. 

It is a pretty bare-bones GUI, in terms of logic. Everything is delegated to the backend,
basically.

(Screenshot pending)

## Future

It will eventually support controls for viewing and editing PGN-files (using pl-chess as backend).

I plan to do a similar project with a UCI engine, exposing it with a simple GUI. The idea is that
this GUI should be able to launch the UCI engine and report moves to it, e.g over TCP/IP but otherwise
they are both standalone processes.
